The distribution is approximately centered around zero, which is expected if there is no real difference between the two groups (boys and girls).\nThe red line which is located in the far right indicates the observed difference in means between boys and girls in the actual data.\nSince the observed difference is in the far-right tail of the null distribution, it means that this difference is unlikely to occur by random chance. This is further supported by the size of the p-value which is 0.011. This is less than 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis.\nSource of Data: https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/openintro/blob/HEAD/R/data-present.R Co-authored-by: Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel cetinkaya.mine@gmail.com"
